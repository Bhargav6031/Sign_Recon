# Sign_Recon

Some of the major problems faced by a person who are unable to speak is they cannot express
their emotion as freely in this world. Utilize that voice recognition and voice search systems
in smartphone(s). Audio results cannot be retrieved. They are not able to utilize (Artificial
Intelligence/personal Butler) like google assistance, or Apple's SIRI etc. because all those apps
are based on voice controlling.


American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made by
moving the hands combined with facial expressions and postures of the body. It is the go-to
language of many North Americans who are not able to talk and is one of various
communication alternatives used by people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. While sign
language is very essential for deaf-mute people, to communicate both with normal people and
with themselves, is still getting less attention from the normal people One of the solutions to
talk with the deaf-mute people is by using the mechanisms of sign language.

Hand gesture is one of the methods used in sign language for non-verbal communication. It is
most commonly used by deaf & dumb people who have hearing or talking disorders to
communicate among themselves or with normal people. Various sign language systems have
been developed by many manufacturers around the world but they are neither flexible nor
cost-effective for the end users.


Our strategy involves implementing such an application which detects pre-defined American
sign language (ASL) through hand gestures. For the detection of movement of gesture, we
would use basic level of hardware component like camera and interfacing is required. Our
application would be a comprehensive User-friendly Based system built on Tkinter module.
This application simply detects the gesture and displays appropriate alphabet.
